A debian based operating system designed for ethical hacking

**INSTILLATION**

For virtual box, install the virtual box file and run using the software, I reccomend at least 4gb of ram but try to use 8.

For the iso, use a tool like ethcer to burn to a usb or disk.

Red os comes with two users, root and red. Red is used for the gui, and the deafult password is ADMIN.
Root, can be accsesed using su root, then the password wich is red.

Red os comes with a bunch of software for hacking pre installed. a full list can be found within the doccument folder.
